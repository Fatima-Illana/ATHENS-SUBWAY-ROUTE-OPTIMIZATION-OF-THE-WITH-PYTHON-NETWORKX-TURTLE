# ATHENS SUBWAY ROUTE OPTIMIZATION USING A* ALGORITHM, NETWORKX AND TURTLE

This repository contains a project simulating routes in the Athens subway, where the A* algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path between stations. We use Python and the libraries `NetworkX` for graph management and `Turtle` for route visualization.

## Description

The project implements the A* search algorithm to optimize routes in the Athens subway network. Using `NetworkX`, the station network and distances are modeled as a graph, where the A* algorithm calculates the optimal path between a starting station and a destination.

The graphical interface uses `Turtle` to visually display the route, highlighting the path with its respective stations and transfers.
