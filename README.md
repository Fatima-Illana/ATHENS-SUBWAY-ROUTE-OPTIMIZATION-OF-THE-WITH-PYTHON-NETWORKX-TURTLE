# ATHENS SUBWAY ROUTE OPTIMIZATION USING A* ALGORITHM, NETWORKX AND TURTLE

This repository contains a project simulating routes in the Athens subway, where the A* algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path between stations. We use Python and the libraries `NetworkX` for graph management and `Turtle` for route visualization.

## Description

The project implements the A* search algorithm to optimize routes in the Athens subway network. Using `NetworkX`, the station network and distances are modeled as a graph, where the A* algorithm calculates the optimal path between a starting station and a destination.

The graphical interface uses `Turtle` to visually display the route, highlighting the path with its respective stations and transfers.

## Files

- **MetroAtenas.py**: Code implementing the interface and the A* algorithm.
- **MetroAtenas.gif**: Image of the Athens subway map.
- **metro_Atenas.xlsx**: Excel file containing distances between stations.
- **CapturasFuncionamiento Folder**: Contains screenshots that shows the interface working.

The contents are only available in spanish.

## Execution

Download all files and store them in the same folder. Otherwise, modify the file paths in the main code and run it. Once execution is complete, click anywhere on the screen to exit the interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NetworkX
- Turtle
